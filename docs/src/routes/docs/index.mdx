# Tombi: TOML Toolkit

Welcome to the Tombi documentation!

Tombi (鳶) is a powerful toolkit that provides a [TOML](https://toml.io/) `Formatter`, `Linter`,
and `Language Server` to help you maintain clean and consistent TOML files.

## Getting Started

Visit our [Quick Start Guide](/docs/installation) to begin using Tombi in your projects.

## Why Tombi?

TOML has become a popular configuration format used in many modern development tools, including [pyproject.toml](https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/) for Python and [Cargo.toml](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html) for Rust.

While TOML offers several advantages over other configuration formats:
- Unlike JSON, it supports comments and has a more human-readable syntax
- Unlike YAML, it has a simpler specification with fewer implicit behaviors

However, unlike YAML and JSON, TOML has lacked a reliable and comprehensive tooling solution. While YAML has an excellent [Language Server](https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server) created by RedHat, and JSON has widespread IDE support, TOML developers have been missing similar robust tooling.

We created Tombi to support teams that use TOML as their configuration format. Our goal is to provide a reliable and efficient development experience for TOML files.
