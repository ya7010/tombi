# JSON Schema

While TOML itself may introduce [schema specifications](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/issues/792) in the future,
Tombi, like Taplo, is implementing validation features in its linter that support [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/).

Currently, we are extending JSON Schema with special annotations using the `x-tombi-*` prefix.

## Schema Priority
This section explains how Tombi prioritizes the application of `x-tombi-*` keys in your JSON Schema:

1. `#:schema` directive in the TOML file's top comment (compatible with [Taplo](https://taplo.tamasfe.dev/configuration/directives.html#the-schema-directive))
2. JSON Schema specified in [the Tombi configuration file](/docs/configuration#search-priority)
3. JSON Schema from the JSON Schema Store

## Formatting
### x-tombi-toml-version
This key automatically determines the TOML version to use.
Currently, we support:
- `v1.0.0` (stable)
- `v1.1.0-preview` (experimental)

The preview version includes exciting features like trailing comma support in Inline Tables.

<Note>
Until `v1.1.0` is officially released, we recommend using `v1.0.0`.

For experimental purposes, the JSON Schema in `tombi.toml` is specified as `v1.1.0-preview`.
</Note>

### x-tombi-table-keys-order

This key controls the automatic sorting of table keys (e.g., `[dependencies]`).

Available sorting strategies:
- `ascending`
- `descending`
- `schema`

<Note>
When using the `schema` strategy, we recommend avoiding `additionalProperties` or `patternProperties` as they are not sorted with `properties` and will appear at the end.
</Note>

## Linting
### Strict Mode
By default, Tombi operates in `strict` mode. In this mode, objects without `additionalProperties` are treated as if `additionalProperties: false` was specified.
This differs from the standard JSON Schema specification but provides more precise validation by eliminating ambiguity.

To disable strict mode, add `schema.strict = false` to your `tombi.toml` configuration.

## Language Gap
While TOML and JSON are different languages, JSON Schema remains a valuable tool for representing TOML structures, especially given the abundance of existing schema assets.

Tombi bridges this language gap by using abbreviations to represent JSON Schema concepts that don't have direct equivalents in TOML.
